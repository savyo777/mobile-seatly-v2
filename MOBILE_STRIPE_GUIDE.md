# MOBILE_STRIPE_GUIDE.md — Wiring Stripe into the Cenaiva mobile diner app

> **⚠️ UPDATE NOTICE (2026-05-21)** — The fee model described below has been **superseded by Option B**. See [`STRIPE_UPDATES.md`](./STRIPE_UPDATES.md) for the canonical spec. Diners now see THREE explicit line items at checkout (Deposit · Platform fee 5.5% · Processing fee gross-up), and refunds return only the deposit base — both fees are non-refundable and disclosed upfront. The math in `lib/stripe/stripeFee.ts:computeDinerCharge` is already correct; what changed is the UI rendering and disclosure copy. Mobile parity for the new Option B model shipped 2026-05-21 in:
>
> - `app/booking/[restaurantId]/step6-payment.tsx` — 3-line cart at deposit checkout
> - `app/(customer)/orders/pay/[orderId].tsx` — 3-line cart at post-meal pay-the-bill
> - `components/booking/SplitTenderCheckout.tsx` — per-payer 3-line breakdown
> - `app/booking/[restaurantId]/step2-time.tsx` — modify-reservation Alert mentions fees non-refundable
> - `app/(customer)/bookings/[id].tsx` — cancel Alert clarifies the deposit base refunds + fees are kept
> - i18n keys added: `booking.platformFeeLabel`, `booking.feeDisclosureV2`, `booking.cancelRefundNote`, etc. (en + fr)
>
> Read STRIPE_UPDATES.md first. The rest of THIS guide describes the older absorption-threshold model and is kept as background context for how the system evolved; do not implement any new feature from this guide's §1 math without cross-referencing STRIPE_UPDATES.md.

Companion to `DINER_MOBILE_GUIDE.md` (general diner mobile handoff). This doc
covers everything money-related: how charges flow, which edge functions to
call, the schema shape of payment rows, the cancel / refund rules, and how
account deletion interacts with in-flight payments.

Mobile is a **consumer** of the platform's payment infrastructure. It does
not modify schema, does not call Stripe's secret API directly, and does not
mint PaymentIntents itself. Every interaction with money goes through a
Cenaiva edge function that holds the Stripe secret server-side.

If anything in this doc conflicts with code, **code is the source of
truth** — re-read the file the doc points at and update this guide. The
on-disk paths in this doc are relative to repo root
`/Users/mark_habbi/Seatly-12/`.

This guide is current as of **2026-05-20** for the historical sections; the
Option B parity update happened **2026-05-21** (see notice above).

## 0. One day in the life — the whole system in one page

Read this first. The rest of the doc dives into each piece in
detail; this section stitches them together so you have the full
picture before zooming in.

### A restaurant owner signs up

1. Owner lands on `cenaiva.com/setup?new=1`. Walks the 8-step wizard
   (`apps/web/src/pages/auth/SetupPage.tsx` orchestrates,
   `apps/web/src/components/onboarding/Step{1-8}*.tsx` are the
   steps).
2. Step 1 hits `signup-restaurant-owner` edge fn which creates the
   `restaurants` row + a default "Dinner" shift + a Main Floor
   section + the owner's `user_restaurant_roles` row. The URL
   becomes `/setup?restaurant_id=<new-id>` so refreshes resume.
3. Steps 2–7 collect hours, tables, booking rules, menu, photos +
   theme colors, deposit policy. Each step writes directly to
   `restaurants` / `shifts` / `tables` / `menu_items` /
   `restaurant_sections`.
4. Step 8 mounts two things:
   - **Stripe Connect Embedded** for KYC + bank-account setup
     (`<ConnectAccountOnboarding>`). Owner enters business details,
     beneficial owner info, and Canadian bank routing (transit #,
     institution #, account #). When the `account.updated` webhook
     fires, `stripe_charges_enabled` flips to true and the card
     turns green: **"You're verified and ready to accept payments."**
   - **Subscription card capture** (`<SubscriptionCard>`) — saves the
     owner's card via `save-subscription-payment-method` →
     `payment_method_attached_at` is set. **No charge yet. No trial
     clock yet.** Apple Pay + Google Pay are enabled here (auto
     mode); Link is off.
5. Owner clicks **Publish my restaurant** → confirmation modal shows
   the $199.99 CAD/mo trial-start disclosure → `publish-restaurant`
   edge fn atomically creates the Stripe Subscription
   (`trial_period_days: 90`) AND flips `is_published=true` AND
   sends the `restaurant_live` email. If a referral code was used,
   `apply-referral-credit` mints a $199.99 coupon for both
   restaurants.
6. The `restaurants_publish_gate` DB trigger guards the flip — even
   if the client UI is bypassed, the row can't go public unless
   all four gates pass: `is_active=true`, `stripe_charges_enabled=true`,
   active subscription OR `payment_method_attached_at IS NOT NULL`,
   and `cover_photo_url IS NOT NULL`.

### A diner books and pays

1. Diner finds the restaurant on Discover or a direct slug URL →
   loads `RestaurantPublicPage`. Theme colors from the restaurant's
   `settings_json.theme` re-skin the page via `applyRestaurantTheme()`.
2. Diner picks date/time/party → if party size triggers a deposit
   tier, `compute_deposit_for_party` RPC returns the amount.
3. Diner fills name/email/phone, optionally adds pre-order items
   from the menu, then clicks Pay.
4. Frontend computes the cart total via `apps/web/src/lib/stripe-fee.ts`
   `computeDinerCharge(baseCents)`:
   - **`base < $12`:** Stripe's ~2.9%+30¢ fee is grossed up onto the
     diner. Cart shows "Processing fee" line item.
   - **`base ≥ $12`:** Cenaiva absorbs the Stripe fee. No
     "Processing fee" line shown.
5. `create-public-payment-intent` creates a PI with:
   - `amount = dinerTotalCents` (the grossed-up or absorbed total)
   - `application_fee_amount = 5.5% of base` (never grossed up)
   - `transfer_data.destination = restaurant.stripe_account_id`
   - `payment_method_types: ["card"]` (wallets currently off on
     diner-side; flip this for mobile when wallets are ready)
6. Stripe Elements `PaymentElement` collects card → `stripe.confirmPayment`
   → success → either the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook OR
   the client-side `confirm-deposit-paid` edge fn flips
   `reservation_deposit_payments.status='charged'` and the settle
   trigger flips the reservation to `'confirmed'`.
7. Confirmation SMS + email go to the diner (via Twilio + Resend).
8. **Same booking, AI-initiated:** if Hey Cenaiva voice or
   cenaiva-chat AI made the booking, the bot hands off the diner
   to `/{slug}?order_id=<id>&step=checkout` for the diner to pay
   in the same Stripe Elements form. The web payment infrastructure
   is identical; only the booking trigger differs.
9. **Owner gets an email** (`notifyOwnerNewReservation`) — gated by
   their per-owner `notification_preferences_json.new_reservation_email`
   toggle on `user_profiles`. Recipient is the owner's
   `user_profiles.email` (not the shared `restaurants.email` inbox).

### Behind the scenes, every confirmed booking

10. DB trigger seeds a `restaurant_booking_fees` row (`status='pending'`,
    `amount_cents=100` = $1 CAD).
11. Hourly `pg_cron` runs `bill-booking-fees` edge fn → each pending
    row becomes a `stripe.invoiceItems.create` on the restaurant's
    subscription customer → rolls into next month's invoice → row
    flips to `'billed'`.

### The diner cancels

12. `/bookings` → cancel button (only shown for future reservations).
    `cancel-reservation` edge fn:
    - Retrieves `application_fee_amount` from each related PI via
      Stripe API.
    - Refunds `(dinerTotalCents − applicationFee)` → restaurant
      returns 94.5%, Cenaiva keeps the 5.5% commission as
      cancellation cost.
    - Fires `notifyOwnerCancellation` to the owner.
    - Releases the table back into availability.

### Restaurant's monthly Stripe invoice fires

13. Stripe sends the invoice to the owner's card on file. It includes
    the $199.99 subscription line + every `bill-booking-fees`
    invoice item that accumulated since the last invoice.
14. `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook fires →
    `handleInvoicePaymentSucceeded` inserts two `expenses` rows for
    the owner's books (subscription + booking-fees aggregate) and
    sends a `payment_received` email with a link to the Stripe-hosted
    invoice PDF.
15. If the card fails, `customer.subscription.updated` with
    status='unpaid' fires → `handleSubscriptionUpsert` unpublishes
    the restaurant + sends a `payment_failed` email. When the owner
    updates their card and a retry succeeds, the same webhook path
    re-publishes the restaurant.

### Owner deletes the restaurant

16. `delete-restaurant` soft-deletes (sets `deleted_at`,
    `scheduled_purge_at = NOW() + 30 days`, `is_published=false`),
    and tells Stripe to `cancel_at_period_end=true` on the active
    subscription. Bookings/payments/orders untouched.
17. Owner has 30 days to `recover-restaurant`. After that, daily
    `purge-deleted-restaurants` cron anonymizes the PII (name →
    "Deleted Restaurant", email/phone nulled, payment_method_attached_at
    cleared) but **keeps the row** so payment / booking-fee FKs
    remain intact for CRA 7-year retention.

That's the entire system. The rest of this doc explains each piece
in detail.

## 1. Money model — who charges whom, who keeps what

Cenaiva uses Stripe Connect with **Express** connected accounts (one per
restaurant — set in `supabase/functions/create-stripe-account/index.ts:143-156`,
country=CA, mcc=5812 Eating Places, card_payments + transfers
capabilities). Every diner charge is a **destination charge**:
`transfer_data.destination = restaurant.stripe_account_id`. Result: the
money lands in the restaurant's Stripe balance the instant Stripe approves
the charge, minus a 5.5% platform application fee that stays with Cenaiva.

| Charge type | Who pays | Who receives | Platform fee | Stripe fee paid by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-ordered food + tax | Diner | Restaurant | 5.5% (app fee) | **Diner if base < $12, else Cenaiva** |
| Booking deposit | Diner | Restaurant | 5.5% (app fee) | **Diner if base < $12, else Cenaiva** |
| Post-meal pay-the-bill | Diner | Restaurant | 5.5% (app fee) | **Diner if base < $12, else Cenaiva** |
| Monthly subscription ($199.99 CAD) | Restaurant | Cenaiva platform | n/a | Cenaiva |
| Per-reservation fee ($1) | Restaurant | Cenaiva platform | n/a (billed monthly) | Cenaiva |

### The $12 gross-up threshold

`supabase/functions/_shared/stripe-fee.ts` `computeDinerCharge(baseCents)`
inspects `baseCents` against `ABSORB_FEE_THRESHOLD_CENTS = 1200`
($12 CAD):

- **`baseCents < 1200`** (small charge): Stripe's ~2.9%+30¢ fee
  ate too much of a small total, so we **gross it up** onto the
  diner. Formula: `dinerTotalCents = ceil((base + 30) / 0.971)`. A
  $1 deposit becomes $1.37 to the diner; the restaurant still gets
  $1 (minus app fee), Cenaiva still keeps 5.5%, Stripe takes its
  $0.34 from the diner's $1.37. Returns `{ dinerPaysFee: true }`.

- **`baseCents >= 1200`** (normal charge): **Cenaiva absorbs** the
  Stripe fee out of its 5.5% commission. `dinerTotalCents === baseCents`,
  no "Processing fee" line shown on the cart. Returns
  `{ dinerPaysFee: false, processingFeeCents: 0 }`.

The client mirror at `apps/web/src/lib/stripe-fee.ts` runs the same
math so the cart UI displays the same total before the PI is created.
The cart only shows "Processing fee" when `dinerPaysFee === true`
(see `RestaurantPublicPage.tsx:1733-1734`).

### Application fee — always on base

Regardless of gross-up state, `application_fee_amount = round(base × 0.055)`
(minimum 1¢). We never take commission on the pass-through Stripe fee.
End result:

| Scenario | Diner pays | Restaurant nets | Cenaiva nets | Stripe takes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small charge ($1 base, grossed up) | $1.37 | $0.945 | $0.055 | ~$0.34 |
| Normal charge ($100 base, absorbed) | $100 | $94.50 | ~$2.30 (after Stripe fee out of its $5.50) | ~$3.20 |

Above $11.54 break-even, Cenaiva profits even when absorbing the fee.

### Stripe minimum charge

Stripe rejects card charges below **$0.50 CAD** at the API level.
`create-public-payment-intent/index.ts:399-400` enforces this
client-side too: any request with `amount_cents < 50` returns 400
`amount_cents must be a number >= 50`. After gross-up, even a $0.10
deposit becomes ~$0.40 + Stripe's minimum — so a real-world deposit
should always clear $0.50.

If the diner has a saved card on a `setup_future_usage` PI, the
minimum still applies — there's no way around it.

**Cancellation policy** (2026-05-16, see §6): `cancel-reservation` issues
a **partial refund** of `(total − application_fee_amount)`. The diner gets
back only the restaurant's 94.5% slice; Cenaiva keeps the 5.5% as a
cancellation cost. Stripe's processing fee on the original charge is never
returned by Stripe — Cenaiva paid it and never recovers it.

**Net per cancelled $100 base transaction (absorbed-fee path, the
common case for any deposit ≥ $12):**
- Diner paid: $100 (no gross-up — Cenaiva absorbed the Stripe fee)
- Stripe took: ~$3.20 (processing fee on the $100)
- Cenaiva net on the book: $5.50 commission − $3.20 Stripe fee = **+$2.30**
- Restaurant netted on book: $94.50 (base × 94.5%)
- On cancel: restaurant returns $94.50; diner gets back $94.50; diner
  loses the $5.50 commission as cancellation cost
- Stripe's $3.20 processing fee is non-recoverable (Cenaiva eats it)

**Net per cancelled $1 base transaction (grossed-up path, small
charges only):**
- Diner paid: ~$1.37 ($1 base + ~$0.37 grossed-up Stripe fee)
- Stripe took: ~$0.34 (processing fee on the $1.37)
- Cenaiva net: $0.055 commission (5.5% of $1 base) + ~$0.03 spread = **~+$0.09**
- Restaurant netted on book: ~$0.945
- On cancel: restaurant returns $0.945; diner gets back $0.945; diner
  loses $0.055 commission + ~$0.37 Stripe fee

**Break-even** for Cenaiva on the **absorbed-fee path** is **$11.54
base** — any transaction at or above that threshold is profitable
even though we eat Stripe's fee. Below $12, the gross-up kicks in
and every transaction is profitable regardless of size (Cenaiva keeps
the full 5.5% since the diner covered Stripe's cut).

**Currency:** CAD for all diner-facing charges. Restaurants are
Canadian-only at launch.

**Mobile's only money job:** present amounts truthfully to the diner,
collect card details via the Stripe Mobile SDK, hand the resulting
PaymentMethod / PaymentIntent ids to Cenaiva edge functions, surface the
result. Never compute platform fees client-side — server is authoritative.

---

## 2. Stripe account architecture mobile needs to know

| Object | Lives on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cenaiva platform account | Cenaiva's Stripe org | Owns the secret key, charges subscriptions, collects app fees |
| Connected restaurant account | Each restaurant | `stripe_account_id` stored on `restaurants` row. Diner charges destination-route here |
| Platform Customer (for restaurant sub) | Platform account | `stripe_customer_id` on `restaurants` row. Used for monthly billing only |
| Platform Customer (for diner card-on-file) | Platform account | `stripe_customer_id` on `user_profiles` row. Used for saved-card mode + post-meal charges |
| Diner card | Tokenized via Stripe SDK | Never stored in Cenaiva DB. Mobile uses Stripe's PaymentSheet or CardField; gets back a `pi_*` or `pm_*` token |

Mobile does NOT need its own Stripe publishable key handling — it uses the
**Cenaiva publishable key** (one key, platform-level). The destination
account routing happens server-side when the PaymentIntent is created.

### 2a. Why diners' saved cards live on the platform Customer, not the connected restaurant

A diner may book at any restaurant; storing their card on a specific
restaurant's connected account would lock them to that restaurant. Instead,
saved cards attach to a diner-owned `stripe_customer_id` on the platform.
When the diner books, two patterns apply:

- **Destination charge (pre-order + deposit, default flow):** PI is created
  on the platform with `payment_method` + `customer` + `transfer_data.destination`.
  The PM and Customer can live on platform; Stripe routes the funds.
- **Direct charge on connected account (post-meal pay-the-bill, Phase 9):**
  Server first **clones** the platform-account PM to the restaurant's
  connected account via `stripe.paymentMethods.create({ customer, payment_method }, { stripeAccount })`,
  then creates the PI on the connected account with the cloned PM. Cleaner
  refund semantics for post-meal flows. Same economics as destination charges.

Mobile never sees this distinction — both paths return the same response
shape from `create-public-payment-intent` / `stripe-charge-order`.

---

## 3. Stripe Mobile SDK setup

iOS: [Stripe iOS SDK](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) — use **PaymentSheet** (lowest friction).
Android: [Stripe Android SDK](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android) — same, use **PaymentSheet**.
React Native: `@stripe/stripe-react-native` if the app is RN.

**Initialize once at app start** with the publishable key:

```swift
// iOS
StripeAPI.defaultPublishableKey = "pk_test_..." // or pk_live_... in prod
```

```kotlin
// Android
PaymentConfiguration.init(applicationContext, "pk_test_...")
```

Get the publishable key from a Cenaiva config endpoint (don't hardcode —
test vs live differs). Reuse the same key the web app uses; it's also a
platform-level key.

**Do not** call Stripe Connect Account Sessions, Account Onboarding, or
anything platform-side from the diner mobile app. Those are owner-side
flows handled in the restaurant onboarding wizard (web, see §11).

---

## 3a. Apple Pay / Google Pay / Link — current state

**Web (the canonical implementation mobile mirrors):**

- **Diner-side checkout (RestaurantPublicPage, deposit pages):**
  `create-public-payment-intent/index.ts:534-540` creates the PI with
  `payment_method_types: ["card"]` — **wallets are explicitly
  disabled.** Diners on web see only the card form. This was an
  intentional choice to keep the diner UX uniform; flipping it on
  requires removing the `payment_method_types` whitelist and setting
  `automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }` on the PI instead.
- **Owner-side subscription card** (`SubscriptionCard.tsx:201`):
  `wallets: { applePay: "auto", googlePay: "auto", link: "never" }`.
  Apple Pay + Google Pay **are** enabled for owners saving their
  subscription card. Link (Stripe's saved-card-across-merchants
  feature) is explicitly off so owners don't accidentally end up with
  cards on Stripe's Link network instead of our platform Customer.

**Mobile diner app — what to configure (when wallets are enabled):**

1. **Server-side first.** When `create-public-payment-intent` is
   updated to accept a `payment_method_types` override (or removes
   the whitelist), mobile can opt in. Until then, mobile is also
   card-only by virtue of the PI's allowed methods.
2. **Apple Pay:**
   - Create an Apple Merchant ID in Apple Developer Portal
     (`merchant.com.cenaiva.diner` or similar).
   - Add the Merchant ID + Apple Pay capability to the iOS app's
     `.entitlements`.
   - At Stripe SDK init: `StripeAPI.defaultPublishableKey = "pk_…"`
     + `PaymentSheet.Configuration.applePay = .init(merchantId:
     "merchant.com.cenaiva.diner", merchantCountryCode: "CA")`.
   - **Test on a real iOS device or TestFlight** — Apple Pay does
     not work in the iOS Simulator.
3. **Google Pay:**
   - At Stripe SDK init on Android: `PaymentSheet.GooglePayConfiguration(
     environment = TEST | PRODUCTION, countryCode = "CA",
     currencyCode = "CAD", merchantName = "Cenaiva")`.
   - Production requires a Google Pay merchant ID + brand allowlist
     via the Google Pay & Wallet Console.
4. **Link:** Stripe's own saved-card network. For Cenaiva diners,
   leave it `"never"` — same reasoning as owner side.
5. **React Native:**
   `@stripe/stripe-react-native`'s `usePaymentSheet` hook accepts the
   same config object shape; pass `applePay` and `googlePay` keys
   on the PaymentSheet init.

**The web doesn't have an Apple Merchant ID configured** because
diner-side wallets are off. When mobile turns them on, that's a
**production prerequisite** owner-side ops needs to handle on the
Cenaiva platform Apple Developer account before the mobile rollout.

---

## 4. Diner pre-order payment flow

Triggered when the diner picks menu items at checkout and `totalNow > 0`.
The same PaymentIntent will cover **food + tax + (optional) deposit**, all
in one charge.

### 4a. Mount PaymentSheet (no clientSecret yet — deferred PI mode)

The web app uses Stripe's "deferred PaymentIntent" mode so Elements mounts
without a clientSecret and the PI is minted JIT on Place Order. Mobile
should follow the same pattern using `PaymentSheet.IntentConfiguration`
(iOS) or the equivalent on Android, with `mode: .payment`, currency `CAD`,
amount in cents.

Why deferred: the diner might cancel before paying. Minting a PI
immediately would create dangling Stripe records and a slot-hold problem
on the reservation side.

### 4b. On "Place Order" tap

The exact call order, mirroring `apps/web/src/pages/customer/RestaurantPublicPage.tsx`
`handlePlaceOrder` (around line 1700-2070):

```
1. Mobile calls Cenaiva: POST /functions/v1/create-public-payment-intent
   Body: { restaurant_id, amount_cents, currency: "CAD" }
   Response: { client_secret, payment_intent_id }

2. Mobile calls Stripe SDK: PaymentSheet.confirm(client_secret)
   This collects the card and confirms the charge in one shot.
   Result: succeeded | failed.

3. If succeeded — mobile calls Cenaiva: POST /functions/v1/create-public-booking
   Body: { restaurant_id, reserved_at, party_size, shift_id, guest_name,
           guest_email, guest_phone, special_request, items: [...],
           applied_promo_code, payment_intent_id }
   Response: { reservation_id, confirmation_code, deposit_required,
               deposit_amount_cents, order_id }

4. Mobile calls Cenaiva: POST /functions/v1/mark-order-paid
   Body: { order_id, payment_intent_id }
   This flips orders.status='paid' via service-role (RLS blocks
   diner-side direct UPDATEs).

5. IF deposit_required AND deposit_amount_cents > 0:
   5a. Mobile calls: POST /functions/v1/prepare-deposit
       Body: { reservation_id, payers: [{ email, full_name, amount_cents }] }
       Response: { payments: [{ id, amount_cents, status, ... }] }
   5b. Mobile calls: POST /functions/v1/confirm-deposit-paid
       Body: { payment_id: payments[0].id, payment_intent_id }
       The server re-verifies the PI with Stripe and flips the deposit
       row to 'charged' via service-role.

6. Mobile navigates to confirmation screen, shows confirmation_code.
```

### 4c. Race-window recovery (critical)

Between step 2 (Stripe charges card) and step 3 (booking write), the slot
could be taken by another diner. If `create-public-booking` returns
`error.unavailable_reason === 'slot_taken'` (or 409 + `slot_taken`):

```
Mobile calls: POST /functions/v1/refund-payment-intent
  Body: { payment_intent_id, reason: "slot_taken" }
```

Show the diner: "That table was taken right as you paid — your card has
been refunded ($X.XX). Please pick another time." Then return them to the
slot picker.

This is mandatory. Skipping it = ghost charge on the diner's card with no
reservation.

### 4d. What lands in the DB after pre-order succeeds

- `reservations` row: status starts `pending_payment`, flips to `confirmed`
  once all linked deposit rows are charged (or immediately if no deposit).
- `orders` row: status `paid`, `stripe_payment_intent_id` set, `paid_at`
  timestamp, `total_amount` matches order subtotal + tax (NOT including
  deposit — deposit is its own row).
- `order_items` rows: one per menu item.
- `reservation_deposit_payments` row (if applicable): status `charged`,
  same `stripe_payment_intent_id` as the order (single PI covers both),
  `amount_cents` matches the deposit calc.

### 4e. Required diner fields

`create-public-booking` requires BOTH `guest_email` AND `guest_phone`
(non-empty). The booking form on web makes the phone field required;
mobile must do the same. Email is used for confirmation emails + refund
notifications; phone is used for SMS confirmation + alerts. Normalize the
phone to E.164 on submit (`+1XXXXXXXXXX` for NA numbers — see
`apps/web/src/lib/validation/phone-schemas.ts`).

---

## 5. Diner deposit payment flow

If the diner is NOT pre-ordering food but the booking still requires a
deposit (party size triggers the deposit policy), the flow is similar but
shorter. The PaymentIntent amount = just the deposit.

```
1. POST /functions/v1/create-public-payment-intent
   { restaurant_id, amount_cents: deposit_cents, currency: "CAD" }

2. Stripe SDK: PaymentSheet.confirm(client_secret) → succeeded

3. POST /functions/v1/create-public-booking
   { ...booking fields, payment_intent_id, items: [] }
   Returns deposit_required: true, deposit_amount_cents, reservation_id.

4. (skip mark-order-paid — no order was created since items=[])

5. POST /functions/v1/prepare-deposit
   { reservation_id, payers: [{ email, full_name, amount_cents }] }
   Returns payments: [{ id, ... }]

6. POST /functions/v1/confirm-deposit-paid
   { payment_id, payment_intent_id }
   Settle trigger flips reservation.status to 'confirmed'.
```

### 5a. How the deposit amount is computed

`restaurants.deposit_tiers` is a JSONB array: `[{min_party_size, amount_per_person_cents}, ...]`. The highest tier whose `min_party_size <=
party_size` wins (NOT additive). The RPC `compute_deposit_for_party(uuid,
integer)` returns the total cents — mobile should call this to preview the
amount before checkout:

```
Mobile: GET /rest/v1/rpc/compute_deposit_for_party
  Body: { p_restaurant_id, p_party_size }
  Response: integer (total deposit in cents)
```

Always compute server-side. Do NOT replicate the tier logic in mobile
code — owners change tiers in their dashboard and any mobile-side copy
will drift.

### 5b. Free reservation case

If `totalNow === 0` (no pre-order, no deposit), skip the entire Stripe
flow:

```
1. POST /functions/v1/create-public-booking
   { ...booking fields, payment_intent_id: null, items: [] }
   Returns reservation with status='confirmed' immediately.
```

No PaymentIntent, no deposit row, no order row. The trigger doesn't fire
because there's nothing to settle.

## 6. Cancellation flow (updated 2026-05-16)

Diner taps Cancel in the mobile booking detail screen. The mobile UI MUST
show a confirm dialog before the actual cancel fires.

**Policy (2026-05-16):** all cancels — diner, guest (confirmation-code
path), and owner — fully refund the restaurant's 94.5% slice to the diner.
Cenaiva keeps the 5.5% commission as a cancellation cost. The 24h cliff
that previously forfeited the entire amount **was removed**. There is no
longer a different code path based on time-to-reservation.

### 6a. Confirm-dialog copy

| State | Dialog body |
|---|---|
| Payments paid (orders or deposits exist) | "The restaurant will be notified, your table will be released, and $X.XX will be refunded to your original payment method (the 5.5% platform fee is non-refundable). This can't be undone." |
| No payments paid | "The restaurant will be notified and your table will be released. This can't be undone." |

The "$X.XX refunded" amount = sum of `orders.total_amount` (in paid status)
+ sum of `reservation_deposit_payments.amount_cents` (in charged status),
**minus** the 5.5% application fee on each. Mobile can preview this client-
side as `paidCents × 0.945` for display, but the server is authoritative
on the actual refund amount (uses real `application_fee_amount` from
Stripe — handles legacy 5% bookings correctly).

The "payments paid" check: SELECT `orders.status='paid'` rows +
`reservation_deposit_payments.status='charged'` rows tied to this
reservation. See §9.1 for the queries.

### 6b. On confirm

```
POST /functions/v1/cancel-reservation
Body: { reservation_id }
Auth: Bearer token (logged-in diner) or { confirmation_code } (guest-only path)
```

The server:
1. Validates ownership / confirmation code.
2. Rejects past reservations (`reserved_at < now`).
3. Flips `reservations.status='cancelled'`, sets `cancelled_at` and
   `cancellation_reason = "Cancelled by diner"`.
4. For each paid `orders` row: retrieves the PI's `application_fee_amount`
   from Stripe; issues a Stripe refund for `total − application_fee` so
   the diner gets back the restaurant's slice only; marks the order
   `refunded`.
5. Same partial-refund treatment for every `charged`
   `reservation_deposit_payments` row.
6. For multi-payer deposits, fires `notify-deposit-payers-refunded`
   fire-and-forget so non-organizer payers get an email explaining
   their refund.
7. Releases the reservation tables, fans out notify-me alerts to other
   diners watching the slot, sends a cancellation SMS/email.

### 6c. Response shape

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "reservation_id": "...",
  "status": "cancelled",
  "refunds": [
    { "kind": "preorder"|"deposit", "ok": true,
      "payment_intent_id": "pi_...", "amount_cents": 9450 }
  ],
  "refund_total_cents": 9450,
  "actor": "diner",
  "notification_delivery": "delivered" | "skipped" | "failed"
}
```

The `refunds[].amount_cents` reflects what the diner actually got back
(post-fee). There is no longer a `forfeit_total_cents` field or
`within_24h` flag — both were removed when the cliff was removed.

### 6d. Mobile toast after success

```
if (refund_total_cents > 0 && every refund.ok)
   "Reservation cancelled. $X.XX refunded to your card."
else if (any refund.ok === false)
   "Reservation cancelled. Some refunds are still processing — we'll
    email you once they complete."
else
   "Reservation cancelled."
```

### 6e. Snappy UX rule

Close the confirm dialog and show the toast **immediately** after the
edge function returns (~2-3 seconds). Don't wait for the local
reservations list to refetch — fire `void refresh()` in the background.

### 6f. Owner-initiated cancel (Phase 6)

When a restaurant cancels a diner's reservation from the dashboard, the
diner experiences the same refund flow — but the SMS/email opener says
"…the restaurant had to cancel your reservation…" instead of the diner's
default opener. Mobile picks up the difference via `cancellation_reason`
on the reservation row (`"Cancelled by restaurant"` vs `"Cancelled by
diner"`). Diner-side mobile UX: show a different banner: "This reservation
was cancelled by {restaurant_name}. Your $X.XX has been refunded."

### 6g. Edge cases

- **Retried cancel:** the edge function is idempotent. Refunds use a
  `charge_already_refunded` backstop and the status filters
  (`'paid'`/`'charged'`) skip already-refunded rows. Safe to retry on
  network error.
- **Refund Stripe API fails:** the cancel still succeeds, the response
  carries the failure in `refunds[].error`. Mobile toasts the partial
  case.
- **PI retrieve fails (network blip / dead PI):** server falls back to a
  full refund (safe default — diner whole). This is the only path that
  refunds 100% instead of 94.5% under the new policy.
- **Cancelled booking still viewable:** mobile should let the diner open
  the booking detail page even after cancel (for at least 30 days). The
  Payment Summary section should show grey "Refunded" badges so the
  diner has a record.
- **Stub-mode deposits** (`DEPOSIT_STRIPE_STUB_MODE=true`,
  `stripe_payment_intent_id` is NULL): no Stripe refund call; the row is
  flipped to `'refunded'` in DB only. Mobile sees a "Refunded" badge
  identical to real-PI rows.
- **No-PI orders:** legacy/comped orders sometimes have `status='paid'`
  with `stripe_payment_intent_id=NULL`. `cancel-reservation` flips them
  to `'refunded'` in DB only (no Stripe call, no `refunds[]` entry, no
  toast saying money moved — just "Reservation cancelled").

---

## 7. Account deletion flow

When a diner taps "Delete account" in the mobile Account screen,
`delete-account` orchestrates the full teardown. This is type-to-confirm
and irreversible — the auth.users row is hard-deleted.

### 7a. Pre-flight

Mobile must present a typing-confirmation modal:

```
Type your email to delete your account: ___________________

This will:
  - Cancel and refund every upcoming reservation
  - Detach and delete every saved card
  - Permanently delete your profile, voice prefs, and all account data

This can't be undone.
```

The typed string is sent as `email_confirmation` to the edge function;
it must match the auth user's email exactly (case-insensitive).

### 7b. The call

```
POST /functions/v1/delete-account
Body: { email_confirmation: "diner@example.com" }
Auth: Bearer JWT
```

Rate limit: **3/hour per user**.

### 7c. What the server does (in order, on a single request)

1. **Decode JWT** → resolve `auth.users` row + `user_profiles` row.
2. **Validate `email_confirmation`** matches the auth user's email
   (case-insensitive). Mismatch → 400.
3. **Block if the user owns a restaurant.** If `user_restaurant_roles`
   has any row where `role='owner'`, the response is 409:
   `{ error: "Delete your restaurants first.", blockers: { owns_restaurants: true } }`.
   The diner must wind their restaurants down first via
   `/dashboard/settings` (Danger zone, `delete-restaurant` flow).
4. **Auto-cancel upcoming reservations.** For each row where
   `user_profile_id = profile.id`, `status IN ('confirmed',
   'pending_payment')`, and `reserved_at > NOW()`:
   - Server POSTs to `cancel-reservation` with the diner's bearer token
     and `actor: "diner"`. This triggers the full refund pipeline (partial
     refunds, notify-deposit-payers-refunded, table release, etc).
   - If any cancel fails, the entire account-delete aborts at this point.
     Already-cancelled reservations stay cancelled; nothing else is
     touched. Mobile surfaces the error and the diner can retry.
5. **Detach in-flight reservations** (`status IN ('seated', 'arriving')`):
   server runs an UPDATE setting `user_profile_id = NULL` so these rows
   survive the user_profiles cascade. The restaurant still has to close
   the meal out — we just remove the diner's identity. **These are NOT
   refunded** (the diner ate the food / is at the table).
6. **Detach Stripe saved cards.** For each row in `saved_cards` with a
   non-null `stripe_payment_method_id`: call
   `stripe.paymentMethods.detach(pm_id)`. Failures are logged-and-skipped
   (best-effort).
7. **Delete the Stripe Customer.** If `user_profiles.stripe_customer_id`
   is set: call `stripe.customers.del(cust_id)`. Failures are logged-and-
   skipped.
8. **Delete `loyalty_waitlist` row** (no FK cascade from user_profiles).
9. **Delete `user_profiles` row.** Cascades through FK chains for:
   `saved_cards` (gone), `notifications` (gone), `availability_alerts`
   (gone), `reviews`/`snaps` (per FK config), etc.
10. **Delete `auth.users` row** via `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.deleteUser`.
    This hard-deletes the auth identity and all OAuth links.
11. **Delete avatar storage object** (best-effort).

### 7d. Response

Success:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "cancelled_reservation_ids": ["...", "..."],
  "refund_total_cents": 18900
}
```

Block (owns a restaurant):
```json
{
  "error": "Delete your restaurants first.",
  "blockers": { "owns_restaurants": true }
}
```

Partial failure mid-cancel (502): the response carries the offending
reservation id and Stripe error. Mobile shows: "Some refunds couldn't
process — please try again or contact support. Your account is still
active."

### 7e. Mobile toast after success

```
if (refund_total_cents > 0)
   "Account deleted. $X.XX refunded to your card."
else if (cancelled_reservation_ids.length > 0)
   "Account deleted. {N} upcoming reservation(s) cancelled."
else
   "Account deleted."
```

Then immediately sign the diner out and route to the sign-in screen.

### 7f. What's NOT deleted on the diner's side

- **Past completed/seated reservations with `user_profile_id` nulled.**
  These rows persist for restaurant analytics + accounting, with the
  diner's identity removed.
- **`guests` rows** linked to past reservations. The guest table is
  restaurant-side history.
- **Stripe charges / refunds.** Stripe retains its own ledger; deleting
  the Customer doesn't erase historical PaymentIntents on Stripe's side.
- **Voice transcripts.** Conversation logs scoped to the user_profiles
  cascade get deleted; longer-term Deepgram/ElevenLabs logs on their
  platforms are not touched.

### 7g. What if the diner has friends mid-payment on a split deposit?

If the diner ran a split-deposit (Phase 7) and friends haven't paid yet:
- Their `reservation_deposit_payments` rows are owned by the reservation,
  not the diner profile.
- Cancelling the diner's reservation in step 4 cascades the partial-refund
  logic for any *charged* friend rows; *pending* friend rows are just
  abandoned in DB (no Stripe call needed — those friends never paid).
- `notify-deposit-payers-refunded` emails friends whose charged shares
  got refunded.

### 7h. What if the diner is a co-payer on someone else's reservation?

If the deleting diner paid a share on someone else's split-deposit
reservation, their `reservation_deposit_payments` row is NOT cancelled
by step 4 (that step only handles reservations where they're the
organizer). The row's `payer_user_profile_id` becomes a stale reference,
but FK behavior (currently `ON DELETE SET NULL` per
`reservation_deposit_payments`) preserves the row so the restaurant still
sees the payment. The reservation organizer is unaffected.

---

## 8. Post-meal pay-the-bill flow (Phase 9)

When the meal is done and the restaurant generates the final bill, the
diner can pay through the mobile app using a saved card. This flow is
DIFFERENT from booking-time pre-orders:

- Booking-time pre-order uses a **destination charge** (PI on platform,
  funds transferred to restaurant).
- Post-meal pay-the-bill uses a **direct charge on the connected
  account** (PI on restaurant's account; PM cloned from platform).

### 8a. The call

```
POST /functions/v1/stripe-charge-order
Body: { order_id }
Auth: Bearer JWT
```

The server resolves the order → restaurant → connected account, clones
the diner's default `saved_cards.stripe_payment_method_id` to the
connected account, then creates + confirms a PaymentIntent directly on
that account with `application_fee_amount = round(totalCents * 0.055)`.

### 8b. Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "total_charged": 78.50,
  "tip_amount": 12.00,
  "paid_at": "2026-05-16T18:42:11Z",
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_..."
}
```

Or, for SCA:
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "requires_action": true,
  "client_secret": "...",
  "stripe_account_id": "acct_..."
}
```

When `requires_action`, mobile calls
`stripe.handleNextAction(clientSecret)` with the right account context
(the SDK needs to know the PI lives on the connected account, not the
platform — pass the `stripe_account_id` to the SDK call).

### 8c. Pre-flight guards

If the restaurant has no `stripe_account_id` or `stripe_charges_enabled
= false`, the server rejects with:
`{ ok: false, error: "This restaurant cannot accept payments right now. Please contact them directly." }` (HTTP 400).

If the diner has no saved card on file, the server rejects with:
`{ ok: false, error: "No saved card. Please add one in Account > Payment." }` (HTTP 400).

Mobile should pre-check `useSavedCards()` and route to the
"Add a card" flow (SetupIntent) before letting the diner tap "Pay bill."

---

## 9. Edge function API reference

All edge functions are at `https://exbjodmnpdiayfzrdyux.supabase.co/functions/v1/<name>`.
All accept JSON, return JSON, use POST except where noted.

### `create-public-payment-intent`

Mints a Stripe PaymentIntent against the restaurant's connected account.
Has TWO modes:

**Mode A — one-time card (anon, default):**
- **Body:** `{ restaurant_id, amount_cents }`
- **Returns:** `{ mode: "one_time", client_secret, payment_intent_id, amount_cents, application_fee_cents, destination }`
- Mobile mounts PaymentSheet with the `client_secret` and calls `stripe.confirmPayment`.

**Mode B — saved card (Phase 4, JWT-required):**
- **Body:** `{ restaurant_id, amount_cents, saved_card_id }`
- **Returns:** one of:
  - `{ mode: "saved_card", status: "succeeded", payment_intent_id, ... }` — done, fire onPaid.
  - `{ mode: "saved_card", status: "requires_action", payment_intent_id, client_secret }` — call `stripe.handleNextAction(clientSecret)` for SCA.
  - `{ mode: "saved_card", status: "failed", error }` — declined.
- Same destination-charge architecture (no Connect cloning needed).
- **Failure modes:** restaurant not Stripe-onboarded; saved_card_id doesn't belong to caller; Stripe declined; SCA required.

### `create-public-booking`

Atomically books the reservation (and writes the order if `items` is
non-empty). Uses an advisory lock + exclusion constraint to serialize
against other diners booking the same slot.

- **Body:** `{ restaurant_id, reserved_at, party_size, shift_id,
  guest_name, guest_email, guest_phone, special_request, items: [],
  applied_promo_code, payment_intent_id }`
- **Returns (success):** `{ reservation_id, confirmation_code,
  deposit_required, deposit_amount_cents, order_id }`
- **Returns (slot taken):** `{ error, unavailable_reason: "slot_taken" }`
  with HTTP 409. **Mobile MUST call refund-payment-intent here.**
- **Returns (diner double-book):** `{ unavailable_reason: "diner_double_book" }`
  with HTTP 409.
- **Anon-callable:** yes
- **Validation:** `guest_email` AND `guest_phone` both required.

### `mark-order-paid`

Flips an `orders` row from `pending` to `paid` after Stripe confirms.

- **Body:** `{ order_id, payment_intent_id }`
- **Returns:** `{ order: { id, status, paid_at } }`
- **Anon-callable:** yes; server re-verifies the PI with Stripe before
  trusting the status flip.

### `prepare-deposit`

Inserts `reservation_deposit_payments` rows (one per payer). Frontend
supports multi-payer split (Phase 7) — see §10.

- **Body:** `{ reservation_id, payers: [{ email, full_name, amount_cents,
  user_profile_id? }] }`
- **Returns:** `{ reservation_id, deposit_amount_cents,
  payments: [{ id, payer_email, payer_full_name, amount_cents, status,
  pay_url }] }`
- **Anon-callable:** yes

### `confirm-deposit-paid`

Flips a `reservation_deposit_payments` row to `charged` with the real PI.
Service-role write, mirrors `mark-order-paid`. Re-verifies the PI with
Stripe (status must be `succeeded` or `processing`, amount must be ≥
deposit amount).

- **Body:** `{ payment_id, payment_intent_id }`
- **Returns:** `{ deposit: { id, reservation_id, status: "charged",
  amount_cents, stripe_payment_intent_id, paid_at } }`
- **Idempotent:** retried call with same params returns
  `{ deposit, idempotent: true }`.
- **Anon-callable:** yes; security comes from re-verifying the PI.
- **Failure cases:** PI not paid → 400 with the Stripe status in error;
  PI amount < deposit → 400 (anti-fraud); bogus PI id → 500 with Stripe's
  "No such payment_intent" error.

### `confirm-deposit-stub`

Local/dev-only: flips a deposit row to `charged` without minting a real
PI. Anon-callable. **Do not call from production mobile** — production
path is `confirm-deposit-paid` (real Stripe re-verification).

### `cancel-reservation`

Handles diner cancels + owner cancels. Always refunds the restaurant's
94.5% slice; Cenaiva keeps the 5.5% commission.

- **Body (diner):** `{ reservation_id }` (Bearer auth) OR `{ reservation_id,
  confirmation_code }` (guest path)
- **Body (owner/staff, Phase 6):** `{ reservation_id, actor: "owner" }` —
  Bearer auth required, caller must have a role on the restaurant via
  `user_restaurant_roles`.
- **Returns:** `{ ok, status: "cancelled", refunds: [], refund_total_cents,
  actor, notification_delivery, ... }`
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT OR confirmation_code (diner). Bearer JWT required
  for `actor: "owner"`. Without auth: 401.
- **Side effects:** Stripe partial refunds (94.5% of each paid order +
  charged deposit), DB row flips, table release, notify-me fan-out,
  notify-deposit-payers-refunded for non-organizer split-payers,
  cancellation SMS/email.

### `modify-reservation`

Moves a reservation to a new slot AND recalcs the deposit (Phase 8).

- **Body:** `{ reservation_id, date, time, party_size, special_request }`
- **Returns:** `{ ok, reservation_id, reserved_at, party_size,
  deposit_adjustment: { kind: "none" | "charged" | "refunded" | "failed",
  amount_cents, payment_intent_id } }`
- **Failure cases:**
  - `unavailable_reason: "modify_requires_card"` (HTTP 402) — party
    increased, deposit delta needs to be charged, but the diner has
    no saved card. Mobile prompts diner to add a card (via
    SetupIntent flow) then retries.
  - Other unavailable_reasons: `slot_taken`, `diner_double_book`,
    `closed`, `past_shift_close`, etc.
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT OR confirmation_code.

### `stripe-charge-order` (Phase 9)

Charges the diner's default saved card for a post-meal order on the
restaurant's connected account. See §8.

- **Body:** `{ order_id }`
- **Returns:** `{ ok, total_charged, tip_amount, paid_at, payment_intent_id }`
  or `{ ok: false, requires_action: true, client_secret, stripe_account_id }`
  for SCA.
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT.

### `stripe-attach-payment-method` (Phase 4, JWT-required)

Saves a card to the diner's Stripe Customer + inserts a `saved_cards`
row. Called by the booking checkout after a one-time PI succeeds AND
the diner ticked "save card."

- **Body:** `{ payment_intent_id }`
- **Returns:** `{ saved_card: { id, brand, last4, exp_month, exp_year,
  is_default } }`
- **Idempotent:** existing row with same `pm_id` returns
  `{ saved_card, idempotent: true }`.
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT.

### `stripe-setup-intent`

Creates a Stripe Customer (if missing) + SetupIntent for AccountPage's
"add a card" flow. Mobile uses the same when surfacing a Payment
Methods management screen.

- **Returns:** `{ client_secret }` for PaymentSheet/SetupSheet to confirm.
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT.

### `stripe-list-methods`

Lists the diner's saved cards. Used to populate the saved-card picker
on booking + the Payment Methods management screen.

- **Returns:** `{ methods: [{ id, brand, last4, exp_month, exp_year, is_default }] }`
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT.

### `merge-diner-accounts` (Phase 5, JWT-required)

Merges two diner accounts (same email or phone, different auth_user_ids)
under the older one. Re-points all FK rows (reservations, saved_cards,
guests, deposits, reviews, alerts, etc.) and hard-deletes the duplicate
auth.users via `auth.admin.deleteUser`. Audit row written to
`account_merge_audit`.

- **Body:** `{ canonical_auth_user_id, archived_auth_user_id }`
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT; caller must be signed in as ONE of the two
  accounts. Defensive email/phone-match check between profiles before
  merging.
- **Returns:** `{ ok, audit_id, counts: { reservations, saved_cards,
  guests, deposits, ... } }`
- **Irreversible** — no undo. Audit log provides forensics.
- **Stripe limitation:** the duplicate's `stripe_customer_id` is NOT
  merged. Cards on it become orphaned (visible in `saved_cards` but
  uncharge-able because Stripe won't charge a PM attached to a different
  Customer). Workaround: re-add the card after merging.

### `get-deposit-payment-context` (Phase 7, anon)

Powers the public `/deposit/:id` page. Returns the data needed to
display "Hi {payer}, {organizer} booked dinner at {restaurant}, you
owe $X" plus enough to mount Stripe Elements.

- **Body:** `{ payment_id }`
- **Returns:** `{ payment, reservation, restaurant }` — see web's
  `DepositPayPage.tsx` for the shape.
- **Anon-callable:** yes. UUID is the security token.

### `dispatch-deposit-invites` (Phase 7, anon)

After a diner enables split-deposit at booking, fires after the diner's
deposit row is `charged` to email each pending payer their magic link
to `/deposit/<row_id>`. Idempotent: only emails rows with
status='pending' AND `stripe_payment_intent_id IS NULL`.

- **Body:** `{ reservation_id, app_origin?, organizer_email? }`
- **Returns:** `{ ok, total_rows, sent, skipped, failed }`
- **Anon-callable:** yes. Email-only for v1 (no SMS — schema lacks
  payer_phone).

### `notify-deposit-payers-refunded` (Phase 6+)

Fired by `cancel-reservation` after each charged-deposit refund loop.
Sends a Resend email to each non-organizer payer whose row was just
refunded: "Your $X refund — {organizer}'s {restaurant} reservation was
cancelled."

- **Body:** `{ reservation_id, refunded_payer_ids: [...] }`
- **Returns:** `{ ok, sent, skipped, failed }`
- **Anon-callable:** yes; service-role internally. Rate limit 30/60s.
- **Mobile never calls this directly** — it's an internal fan-out from
  cancel-reservation.

### `find-reservation`

Anon-callable lookup for guests who lost their confirmation email. Two
modes (discriminated by `lookup_type`):

**Mode A — by confirmation code:**
- **Body:** `{ lookup_type: "code", code: "SEAT-ABCD" }` (or bare `"ABCD"`)
- **Returns:** `{ ok, reservation: { restaurant_slug, ... } }` on match;
  generic error on miss.
- **Rate limit:** 10/IP/hour.

**Mode B — by contact:**
- **Body:** `{ lookup_type: "contact", email, last_name }`
- **Returns:** ALWAYS the same generic toast — re-sends the original
  confirmation email/SMS if a match is found. Never reveals existence
  of a row to the caller.
- **Rate limit:** 5/IP/hour.

Mobile use case: an in-app "Find my reservation" screen for guests not
signed in, mirroring web's `/find-reservation`.

### `refund-payment-intent`

Race-recovery only. Refunds a Stripe PI without writing any DB row. The
caller (mobile or web) is responsible for any DB bookkeeping.

- **Body:** `{ payment_intent_id, reason }`
- **Returns:** `{ refund_id, status, amount }`
- **Anon-callable:** yes. Only meant for the slot-taken race; not a
  generic refund button.

### `delete-account`

Permanent diner account deletion. See §7 for the full flow.

- **Body:** `{ email_confirmation: <auth.users.email> }`
- **Returns:** `{ ok, cancelled_reservation_ids, refund_total_cents }`
- **Auth:** Bearer JWT.
- **Rate limit:** 3/hour per user.
- **Blockers:** owns a restaurant → 409 with
  `{ blockers: { owns_restaurants: true } }`.

## 9a. Voice / Hey Cenaiva booking-to-payment handoff

**Voice is out of scope for the diner mobile app** (per
`DINER_MOBILE_GUIDE.md`) — this section documents the data flow so
mobile devs understand how AI-assisted bookings hit the same payment
infrastructure on the web side. Mobile should treat any reservation
written via the voice path identically to a manually-entered one.

### How voice bookings reach the payment layer

`cenaiva-orchestrate/index.ts` (voice path) and `cenaiva-chat/index.ts`
(text-chat path) both end up at one of:

1. **`completeBooking()` in `_shared/booking.ts`** (used by
   `cenaiva-orchestrate`): runs the `book_reservation` RPC + diner
   confirmation SMS + owner notification. Returns the new
   `reservation_id` + `order_id` if a pre-order was included.
2. **Direct `book_reservation` RPC call** (used by `cenaiva-chat`):
   inserts the reservation row with `p_status='confirmed'` and an
   optional pre-order order row.

### Voice handoff when payment is required

The voice/AI flows don't collect card data themselves — they hand off
to `RestaurantPublicPage` via URL params for the diner to complete
payment in a normal Stripe Elements form:

| Scenario | Voice redirects to | RestaurantPublicPage handles |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-order with payment | `/{slug}?order_id=<id>&step=checkout` | Mounts `StripePaymentForm` at the checkout step; reads the order total + items from the DB row |
| Booking deposit required | `/{slug}?step=checkout&date=…&time=…&party=…` | Re-mounts the booking widget pre-filled; deposit banner shown above the Pay button |
| Successful no-payment booking | `/{slug}?step=menu` | Lands on the menu so the diner can optionally add a pre-order |

`RestaurantPublicPage.tsx:1142` reads `searchParams.get("order_id")` to
detect a voice pre-pay handoff (`cameFromCenaivaPrepay`); the page
then auto-advances the wizard state to the checkout step instead of
making the diner re-navigate.

### Voice booking → owner notification

Both `completeBooking` and the cenaiva-chat direct path call
`notifyOwnerNewReservation()` from `_shared/owner-notifications.ts`
(fire-and-forget) after the reservation row commits. Per-owner
toggles in `user_profiles.notification_preferences_json` gate the
send — so a voice-initiated booking and a web-form booking are
indistinguishable from the owner's email inbox.

### Voice booking → cancellation

Voice doesn't have a "cancel" command yet (per CLAUDE.md pending
follow-ups). Cancellations always go through the web
`cancel-reservation` flow, which fires `notifyOwnerCancellation()`
the same way regardless of how the booking was originally created.

## 10. Multi-payer deposit split (Phase 7)

Diner can invite friends to chip in their share of the deposit at
booking time.

### 10a. The checkout-side toggle

When `previewDepositDollars > 0`, show "Split deposit with friends"
checkbox. When toggled, render N payer rows (name + email each), up
to `party_size - 1` friends. Equal split:
`each = totalDeposit / (1 + friends.length)`.

The diner pays only their share inline. `totalNow` becomes
`preorder + (deposit / (1 + friends.length))`.

### 10b. The booking call sequence

After the diner's Stripe payment succeeds:

```
1. create-public-booking → reservation created in pending_payment
2. prepare-deposit with payers: [diner_share, ...friend_shares]
   → returns N payment rows (diner is index 0)
3. confirm-deposit-paid with payments[0].id + diner's PI id
   → marks diner's row 'charged'
4. dispatch-deposit-invites with reservation_id + app_origin +
   organizer_email
   → server emails each friend a link to /deposit/<row_id>
```

Reservation stays `pending_payment` until ALL deposit rows are
charged. The settle trigger handles the flip to `confirmed`.

### 10c. The public `/deposit/:id` page

Mobile equivalent of the web `DepositPayPage`. Anonymous (no auth
required — UUID in URL is the security token).

```
1. POST /functions/v1/get-deposit-payment-context { payment_id }
   → returns { payment, reservation, restaurant }
2. Show "Hi {payer.full_name}, {organizer.full_name} booked dinner
   at {restaurant.name} on {reserved_at}. Pay your share of {amount}."
3. Mount Stripe PaymentSheet for that exact amount.
4. On confirm, POST /functions/v1/confirm-deposit-paid with
   payment_id + payment_intent_id.
5. Show success state.
```

Deep-link: register `cenaiva://deposit/:id` as a Universal Link
(iOS) / App Link (Android) so emailed magic links open the mobile
app directly to the pay screen instead of the browser.

### 10d. Known limitations

- Email-only invites (no SMS) — `reservation_deposit_payments`
  schema lacks `payer_phone`. Future enhancement.
- No payer-payment timeout. If a friend never pays, reservation stays
  `pending_payment` indefinitely. Organizer or restaurant must cancel
  manually.

## 11. Restaurant Stripe Connect (business side — out-of-scope but context)

Mobile diners don't onboard restaurants — that's a web-only wizard. But
to understand the data model, here's what restaurants go through at
signup. **Mobile must never trigger any of these flows** — diner mobile
should refuse to render a restaurant-side flow even if instructed.

### 11a. The 8-step onboarding wizard

The owner signs up via `/setup` (gated by `<RequireAuth>`). The wizard
saves to `restaurants` row across 8 steps:

1. Basics (name, slug, cuisine, owner contact)
2. Location (address geocoded + Google Place id)
3. Hours (per-day open/close)
4. Tables (floor plan)
5. Photos (cover, logo, gallery — 5MB cap via `assertImageSizeOk`)
6. Menu (categories + items + prices)
7. Deposit policy (tiers JSONB)
8. Payment setup (THE STRIPE STEP — see below)

The publish-gate trigger `enforce_publish_gate()` on `restaurants` BEFORE
UPDATE blocks `is_published=false→true` transitions unless ALL of:
- `is_active = true`
- `stripe_charges_enabled = true` (from `account.updated` webhook)
- `subscription_status IN ('trialing', 'active')`
- `cover_photo_url IS NOT NULL`

The client-side check in Step 8 is for UX; the trigger is the trust
boundary (savvy actor can't bypass via direct supabase-js writes).

### 11b. Step 8 — what Stripe wire-up looks like

Step 8 mounts two Stripe components side-by-side:

**Part A — Stripe Connect Embedded Onboarding (KYC + bank account):**
- Edge fn `create-stripe-account` (`supabase/functions/create-stripe-account/index.ts:143-156`)
  creates a Connect **Express** account (country=CA, mcc=5812 Eating
  Places, capabilities `{ card_payments, transfers }`).
  Idempotent — re-running just retrieves the current state. If the
  account was deauthorized externally (owner unlinked from Stripe
  dashboard), the function clears the columns and lets the owner
  re-onboard.
- Edge fn `create-account-session` (`supabase/functions/create-account-session/index.ts:110-115`)
  calls `stripe.accountSessions.create({ account, components: {
  account_onboarding: { enabled: true } } })` and returns the
  `client_secret` for the embedded component.
- Web component `<ConnectAccountOnboarding />` from `@stripe/react-connect-js`
  renders Stripe's hosted KYC flow inline (business details, beneficial
  owners, banking, identity verification).
- On the `onExit` callback, `handleKycExit` (`Step8PaymentSetup.tsx:386-407`)
  polls the restaurant row every 2 seconds for up to 15 attempts (~30s)
  waiting for `stripe_charges_enabled` or `stripe_details_submitted`
  to flip true via the `account.updated` webhook.

**Part A — The "Verified ✓" success state:**

When the polling sees `stripe_charges_enabled === true`, the bank
payout card flips from the embedded onboarding form to a green
success state with the banner **"You're verified and ready to accept
payments."** This is the screenshot the owner sees when KYC clears.

The UI ties to `kycVerified = summary?.stripe_charges_enabled === true`
(`Step8PaymentSetup.tsx:423`). The same flag also gates the
"Publish my restaurant" button (combined with `hasPaymentMethodOnFile
|| subscriptionActive` and `cover_photo_url`). Until KYC verifies,
the publish button stays disabled and the page shows the embedded
onboarding flow.

**Part A.1 — Bank-account / payout setup screen (within the Embedded flow):**

Inside the same `<ConnectAccountOnboarding />` iframe, Stripe renders a
"Set up payouts to your bank → Add an account for payouts" sub-step.
Test-mode shows a yellow "You're using a test account" banner and a
"Use test account" button that auto-fills valid test routing numbers.
The fields collected are Canadian-bank specific:

| Field | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Currency | Locked to CAD for CA-country accounts | `CAD - Canadian Dollar` |
| Transit number | 5 digits | `11000` |
| Institution number | 3 digits | `000` |
| Account number | up to 12 digits | `000123456789` |
| Confirm account number | matches above | `000123456789` |

These map 1:1 to Stripe's
[`bank_accounts.create`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/bank_accounts/create-account)
params; the embedded UI calls Stripe directly — Cenaiva never sees or
stores the account number. The connected account holds the relationship
to the bank; payouts are scheduled per
`create-stripe-account`'s `settings.payouts.schedule.interval = "daily"`.

**For the mobile mirror (out-of-scope for this pass — future work):**
- Web uses `@stripe/connect-js` + `@stripe/react-connect-js`.
- Mobile equivalent today is to fall back to a `WebView` hosting
  Stripe's hosted Onboarding link from `accountLink.create` —
  `@stripe/stripe-connect-react-native` exists but coverage is limited.
- If using WebView fallback, treat the Stripe URL as authoritative:
  parse only the `account.updated` webhook server-side to flip
  `stripe_charges_enabled`, don't trust any postMessage from the WebView.

**Part B — Subscription card (Stripe Billing):**
- **2026-05-20 lifecycle rework:** card-save is now decoupled from
  trial-start. Step 8's `<SubscriptionCard>` calls
  `save-subscription-payment-method` to attach a card to the
  restaurant's platform Customer. No subscription is created at this
  point — the trial clock hasn't started yet. `payment_method_attached_at`
  is set on the `restaurants` row.
- When the owner clicks "Publish my restaurant" and confirms in the
  modal, `publish-restaurant` atomically creates the Stripe Subscription
  (with `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` = $199.99 CAD/mo recurring Price,
  `trial_period_days: 90`, `payment_behavior: "default_incomplete"`) AND
  flips `is_published=true` — both succeed or both fail.
- The deprecated `create-subscription` edge fn returns **410 Gone** by
  default (set `ALLOW_LEGACY_CREATE_SUBSCRIPTION=true` for emergency
  operator use only).
- Persists `stripe_customer_id`, `subscription_status`, `trial_ends_at`
  to the restaurant row at publish-time.

### 11c. The publish gate UI

The "Publish my restaurant" button is gated client-side on all four
publish-gate conditions. When all green, the button enables. When the
diner taps publish, an UPDATE on `restaurants` sets `is_published=true`;
the DB trigger re-verifies all four gates before allowing the write.

### 11d. stripe-webhook event mapping

The platform's webhook handler (`supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`)
maps Stripe events to DB updates:

| Event | Handler | DB effect |
|---|---|---|
| `account.updated` | `handleAccountUpdated` (line 102–113) | Mirrors `stripe_charges_enabled`, `stripe_payouts_enabled`, `stripe_details_submitted` onto `restaurants`. This is the event that flips the "Verified ✓" banner on Step 8. |
| `account.application.deauthorized` | `handleAccountDeauthorized` (line 115–127) | `stripe_account_id=NULL` + all three KYC flags=false. Restaurant is disconnected and effectively non-functional until they re-onboard. |
| `customer.subscription.created/updated` | `handleSubscriptionUpsert` (line 349–454) | Mirrors `subscription_status`, `trial_ends_at`, `subscription_cancel_at_period_end`, `subscription_paused_at`. **Drives `is_published`:** on `unpaid`/`canceled` → unpublish + `paused_reason='payment_failed'` + `payment_failed` email. On recovery to `trialing`/`active` while previously failed → republish + `payment_recovered` email. Skips entirely if `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` (deletion state protected). |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | `handleSubscriptionDeleted` (line 571–587) | `subscription_status='canceled'`, `is_published=false`, `paused_reason='subscription_cancelled'`. Skipped if `paused_reason='pending_deletion'` (already handled by `delete-restaurant`). |
| `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` | Logged only | Owner notification fires from a separate `notify-trial-ending` cron 7 days pre-expiry. |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | `handleInvoicePaymentSucceeded` (line 179–347) | Inserts 2 `expenses` rows (subscription + booking-fees aggregate) for the owner's bookkeeping. Fires `payment_received` notification with `hostedInvoiceUrl`. |
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | `handlePaymentIntentSucceeded` (line 456–555) | **Hold path:** calls `convert_reservation_hold_to_reservation` RPC + post-conversion side effects (orders/items, promotions). **Reservation path:** updates `reservation_deposit_payments` (status='charged'), `orders` (status='paid'), `reservations` (status='confirmed' via settle trigger). |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | `handlePaymentIntentFailed` (line 557–569) | `reservation_deposit_payments.status='failed'`. |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Logged only | The subscription's status change to `unpaid` is what actually drives unpublish, via the `customer.subscription.updated` event that follows. |

**De-dup:** in-memory `seenEventIds` Set (line 43–54), 500-entry cap.
Stripe retries the same event with the same ID; we ignore duplicates
within the process lifetime. Signature verification via
`constructEventAsync`. The same de-dup pattern handles webhook
replays from Stripe's dashboard "resend" feature.

### 11e. Drafts as a product surface

Restaurants in the middle of the wizard (`is_published=false`) live at
`/drafts`. Mobile is not expected to render this — it's owner-side only.
A `cleanup_stale_restaurant_drafts()` pg_cron job runs daily at 03:00
UTC, deleting unpublished drafts older than 30 days.

### 11f. Operational notes for the platform team

- **Stripe Price for the subscription:** current price is **$199.99
  CAD/mo** (set 2026-05-19, previously $199). Stripe doesn't allow
  editing existing Price amounts. To change the subscription price,
  create a NEW Price on the Cenaiva subscription Product, copy the new
  `price_…` id, and update env var `STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` in
  Supabase project settings. The old Price stays in Stripe but is
  unused for new subscriptions. **`STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID` must
  be a Price ID (`price_…`) — not a Product ID (`prod_…`).** The
  Subscriptions API rejects Product IDs with `resource_missing`.
- **Existing subscribers** are not auto-migrated to new Prices — that
  requires individual Stripe API calls.
- **Per-booking $1 fee** (added 2026-05-19): `restaurant_booking_fees`
  table seeds a `'pending'` row per confirmed reservation via DB
  trigger; `bill-booking-fees` cron sweeps hourly via
  `stripe.invoiceItems.create` on the restaurant's subscription
  customer; rolls into the next monthly invoice.
- **Referral program** (added 2026-05-20): every published restaurant
  has a unique `referral_code`. New restaurants can pass it at signup;
  `apply-referral-credit` creates a $199.99 CAD Stripe coupon applied
  to BOTH subscriptions (`max_redemptions=2`). Audit lives in the
  `referral_credits` table.
- **Auto-pause on payment failure** (added 2026-05-20):
  `stripe-webhook.handleSubscriptionUpsert` now drives `is_published`.
  On `unpaid`/`canceled` → unpublish + `paused_reason='payment_failed'`
  + `payment_failed` email. On recovery → republish +
  `payment_recovered` email. Skips if `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`.

### 11g. Dev environment HTTPS (Vite basic-ssl)

Chrome refuses to enable Stripe Elements' "saved card autofill" on
non-HTTPS pages. Dev on `http://localhost` shows the banner
*"Automatic payment methods filling is disabled because this form
does not use a secure connection"* inside every Stripe iframe — the
form still works, but the saved-card autofill is dead and the warning
clutters Step 8 of the wizard.

**Fix** (shipped 2026-05-20, see `apps/web/vite.config.ts`):

```ts
import basicSsl from "@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss(), basicSsl()],
  server: { https: true, /* … */ },
});
```

This makes Vite serve dev on `https://localhost:5174` with a
self-signed cert. The first time Chrome hits the page it shows the
familiar `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` interstitial ("Your
connection is not private"). The owner clicks **Advanced → Proceed
to localhost (unsafe)** once and Chrome remembers the bypass for the
rest of the session.

After the bypass, the Stripe iframe sees an HTTPS parent and the
autofill warning disappears. This is a dev-only quirk — **production
runs on a real cert (AWS ACM / Cloudflare / Vercel auto-provisions
one)** and the warning never appears for owners or diners on
`https://cenaiva.com/*`.

If `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` is uninstalled or `server.https` is
turned off in `vite.config.ts`, dev reverts to HTTP and the Stripe
warning comes back. Don't disable it for "easier dev" — owners
walking through Step 8 will see the warning and ask questions.

## 12. Database schema for payments (read-only from mobile)

Mobile reads these tables directly via Supabase REST API. RLS does the
authorization — never trust client-side filters as security boundaries.

### `orders`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `reservation_id` | uuid FK | |
| `restaurant_id` | uuid FK | |
| `guest_id` | uuid FK | Diner's guest record |
| `status` | text | `pending`, `paid`, `refunded` |
| `stripe_payment_intent_id` | text nullable | `pi_*` |
| `total_amount` | numeric | Decimal dollars, NOT cents |
| `is_preorder` | boolean | true for pre-order, false for in-person orders |
| `paid_at` | timestamptz | |

RLS: diners SELECT their own (via `guest_id` → user_profile join). UPDATE
is staff-only (the `orders_update_staff` policy) — that's why
`mark-order-paid` runs server-side with service-role.

### `order_items`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `order_id` | uuid FK | |
| `name` | text | Snapshot at order time (not joined to `menu_items`) |
| `quantity` | integer | |
| `unit_price` | numeric | Decimal dollars |
| `line_total` | numeric | |

### `reservation_deposit_payments`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `reservation_id` | uuid FK | |
| `payer_email` | text | Required (check constraint) |
| `payer_full_name` | text | |
| `payer_user_profile_id` | uuid nullable | If diner is logged in |
| `amount_cents` | integer | Cents, NOT dollars |
| `status` | text | `pending`, `charged`, `refunded`, `failed` |
| `stripe_payment_intent_id` | text nullable | `pi_*` after charge |
| `paid_at` | timestamptz | |

RLS: `rdp_diner_select` lets diners SELECT rows where they're the payer
or own the reservation. `rdp_owner_select` lets restaurant staff SELECT.
UPDATE is service-role-only — both `confirm-deposit-paid` and
`cancel-reservation` use service-role for the flip.

### `saved_cards`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `user_id` | uuid FK | references `user_profiles.id` |
| `stripe_payment_method_id` | text | `pm_*` on platform Customer |
| `brand` | text | "visa", "mastercard", "amex", ... |
| `last4` | text | |
| `exp_month` | int | |
| `exp_year` | int | |
| `is_default` | boolean | |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | |

RLS: diner SELECT/INSERT/DELETE their own. Server-side cleanup on
`delete-account` (Stripe PM detach + Customer delete).

### `user_profiles` (payment-relevant)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK |
| `auth_user_id` | FK to `auth.users` |
| `stripe_customer_id` | text nullable. `cus_*` on platform |
| `email`, `phone`, `full_name` | Profile completeness gate uses all three |

The `on_auth_user_created` trigger guarantees a row exists for every
`auth.users` row, but fields may be NULL. `RequireCompleteProfile` gates
on all three being non-empty.

### `reservations` (payment-relevant columns only)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid PK | |
| `user_profile_id` | uuid nullable | Nulled on diner delete-account for `seated`/`arriving` rows |
| `status` | text | `pending_payment`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `arriving`, `seated`, `completed`, `no_show` |
| `deposit_status` | text | `none`, `pending`, `charged` |
| `deposit_stripe_payment_intent_id` | text | DEPRECATED on diner side. The actual PI is on `reservation_deposit_payments.stripe_payment_intent_id`. Use that. |
| `deposit_amount_cents` | integer | Snapshot of expected deposit |
| `preorder_order_id` | uuid FK | Points at the linked `orders` row if any |
| `cancellation_reason` | text | Human-readable when status='cancelled'. Values: `"Cancelled by diner"`, `"Cancelled by restaurant"`, `"Cancelled via Cenaiva"` |

### `restaurants` (payment-relevant)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `stripe_account_id` | Connected account id. `acct_*` |
| `stripe_customer_id` | Platform-account customer for subscription billing. `cus_*` |
| `stripe_charges_enabled` | KYC verified, can accept charges (mirrored by webhook) |
| `stripe_payouts_enabled` | Can receive payouts |
| `stripe_details_submitted` | Onboarding complete |
| `subscription_status` | `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, etc. |
| `trial_ends_at` | timestamptz |
| `deposit_tiers` | JSONB `[{min_party_size, amount_per_person_cents}, ...]` |
| `currency` | `CAD` |
| `is_active` | bool — owner can publish |
| `is_published` | bool — gated by trigger on all 4 publish conditions |

Mobile reads `deposit_tiers` only to display "Deposit required for
parties of N+" hints. Compute amounts via the RPC, not in client code.

### `account_merge_audit`

Audit trail for `merge-diner-accounts`. RLS denies all SELECT — only
service-role / support can read. Records canonical+archived ids, matched
contact field, and counts of moved rows.

---

## 13. Queries mobile needs

### 13.1 "Does this reservation have any payments?" (for cancel-confirm copy)

```ts
const [orders, deposits] = await Promise.all([
  supabase.from("orders")
    .select("status, total_amount")
    .eq("reservation_id", reservationId),
  supabase.from("reservation_deposit_payments")
    .select("status, amount_cents")
    .eq("reservation_id", reservationId),
]);

const paidCents =
  orders.data.filter(o => o.status === "paid")
    .reduce((s, o) => s + Math.round(Number(o.total_amount) * 100), 0) +
  deposits.data.filter(d => d.status === "charged")
    .reduce((s, d) => s + d.amount_cents, 0);

// paidCents > 0 → use "$X.XX will be refunded (5.5% non-refundable)" copy
// paidCents === 0 → use plain "Cancel?" copy
// Estimate the refund preview client-side as paidCents * 0.945 (server
// is authoritative on the actual refund amount).
```

### 13.2 Payment summary for a single reservation (booking detail screen)

```ts
const [{ data: orders }, { data: deposits }] = await Promise.all([
  supabase.from("orders")
    .select("id, status, total_amount, stripe_payment_intent_id, is_preorder, order_items(id, name, quantity, unit_price)")
    .eq("reservation_id", reservationId),
  supabase.from("reservation_deposit_payments")
    .select("id, amount_cents, status, payer_full_name, paid_at")
    .eq("reservation_id", reservationId),
]);
```

Render badge: `paid` → green "Paid"; `refunded` → grey "Refunded" with
struck-through total; `pending` → amber "Pending"; `failed` → red
"Failed".

### 13.3 Preview deposit before checkout

```ts
const { data: cents } = await supabase
  .rpc("compute_deposit_for_party", {
    p_restaurant_id: restaurantId,
    p_party_size: partySize,
  });
// cents: number | null (null = no deposit required for this party size)
```

### 13.4 List saved cards

```ts
// Direct DB read — RLS scopes to current user automatically.
const { data: cards } = await supabase
  .from("saved_cards")
  .select("id, brand, last4, exp_month, exp_year, is_default")
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

Or call `stripe-list-methods` if you want Stripe's authoritative state
(includes cards added via OAuth flows that bypassed the saved_cards
insert).

---

## 14. Status enum reference

```
reservations.status: pending_payment | confirmed | cancelled | arriving | seated | completed | no_show
orders.status: pending | paid | refunded
order_items.status: ordered | preparing | ready | served | cancelled
reservation_deposit_payments.status: pending | charged | refunded | failed
restaurants.subscription_status: trialing | active | past_due | canceled | incomplete | incomplete_expired | unpaid
```

Mobile should treat unknown values defensively (display the raw string)
in case a future migration adds new states.

---

## 15. Error responses & user-facing messages

| Edge fn error | Likely cause | User-facing message |
|---|---|---|
| `slot_taken` (409) | Race window after Stripe success | "That time was taken right as you paid. Your card has been refunded — pick another slot." |
| `diner_double_book` (409) | Diner already has overlapping reservation | "You have another booking at this time. Cancel that one first or pick a different slot." |
| `Past reservations cannot be cancelled` | Trying to cancel a reservation in the past | "This reservation has already happened — it can't be cancelled." |
| `modify_requires_card` (402) | Party-size increase, no saved card on file | "Adding to your party size needs a card on file. Add one in Account → Payment and try again." |
| `PaymentIntent not paid` from `mark-order-paid` / `confirm-deposit-paid` | Stripe declined, network issue | "We couldn't confirm your payment. Please try again or use a different card." |
| `Rate limited` (429) | Too many cancel/book attempts | "You're going too fast — wait a moment and try again." |
| `Delete your restaurants first` (409, `delete-account`) | Diner owns ≥1 restaurant | "You own a restaurant on Cenaiva — please delete it from the dashboard before deleting your diner account." |
| `Email confirmation does not match` (400, `delete-account`) | Typed email differs from auth.users.email | "The email you typed doesn't match. Please retype your account email." |
| `Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code` | The Supabase SDK wrapper hides `body.error` | **Use raw fetch + parse body.error**. See web's `BookingDetailsPage.tsx` for the pattern. |

**Important:** when calling edge functions from mobile, use the native
HTTP client (URLSession on iOS, OkHttp on Android, fetch on RN) NOT the
Supabase SDK `functions.invoke()` — that wraps the error body as a
generic "non-2xx" message and you lose the real reason. Web hit this and
fixed it by switching to raw fetch + parsing `body.error`.

---

## 16. Test cards (Stripe test mode)

Use these only when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is `sk_test_*` and the
publishable key starts with `pk_test_*`. Verify by checking the Stripe
Dashboard has the yellow "TEST DATA" banner.

| Card | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Generic success (most-used) |
| `4000 0025 0000 3155` | Requires 3D Secure / SCA |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Insufficient funds decline |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Generic decline |
| `4000 0000 0000 0119` | Charge processing error |
| `4000 0012 4000 0000` | Canadian Visa (succeeds, useful for CA testing) |

For any test card: any future expiry (`12/29`), any 3-digit CVC (`123`),
any name/postal. Amex test card `3782 822463 10005` uses a 4-digit CVC.

---

## 17. Webhooks (server-side, mobile doesn't subscribe directly)

Mobile does NOT register Stripe webhooks. The platform's `stripe-webhook`
edge function (deployed) handles every Stripe event. See §11d for the
event-to-DB mapping.

Mobile is notified of state changes via Supabase Realtime subscriptions
on `reservations` and `restaurants` tables — same pattern web uses. See
`DINER_MOBILE_GUIDE.md` section on realtime.

---

## 18. Security checklist

- ✅ **Never** embed the Stripe secret key in mobile. Only the
  publishable key.
- ✅ **Never** call Stripe's API directly from mobile (except via the
  Stripe SDK which uses the publishable key for tokenization only).
- ✅ All amount/fee calculations server-side. Mobile only displays.
- ✅ Card tokenization happens inside the Stripe SDK PaymentSheet — the
  app never touches raw PAN.
- ✅ Validate PI ids with `confirm-deposit-paid` / `mark-order-paid`
  server-side — never trust the mobile-provided PI without re-fetching
  from Stripe.
- ✅ Surface the partial-refund (5.5% non-refundable) policy at booking
  time AND at cancel time. Don't surprise the diner.
- ✅ For diners not logged in (guest bookings), the confirmation_code is
  the security token for cancel/modify. Mobile should store it in
  Keychain/Keystore for guest sessions, and offer `/find-reservation`
  recovery via email + last name if lost.
- ✅ Account deletion is a typing-to-confirm + bearer-JWT gated flow.
  Mobile must show the destructive copy ("Cancel and refund every
  upcoming reservation, detach saved cards, permanently delete profile")
  before letting the user confirm.
- ✅ Owner-cancel surfaces (if mobile ever shows a restaurant dashboard
  in-app, which is currently out of scope) MUST pass `actor: "owner"`
  and require the user to have a `user_restaurant_roles` row.

## 19. Implementation order (recommended)

1. **SDK setup + tokenization smoke test.** Initialize Stripe SDK, mount
   PaymentSheet against a test PI generated by your dev backend. Confirm
   a `4242...` charge end-to-end.
2. **Pre-order checkout flow** (§4). Wire all 6 steps. Test on a
   restaurant with no deposit policy first to keep the surface small.
3. **Race-window recovery** (§4c). Force the race by booking the
   last seat from the web, then trying to book it from mobile. Verify
   `refund-payment-intent` fires and the diner sees the recovery message.
4. **Deposit-only flow** (§5). Test with a party of 8 at Mark
   Testing — deposit policy kicks in at `min_party_size=8`,
   `$10/person`, so an 8-person booking = $80 deposit.
5. **Combined pre-order + deposit flow.** Same as #4 but add a menu
   item. Single PaymentIntent covers both. Verify both `orders` row AND
   `reservation_deposit_payments` row land in their respective `paid` /
   `charged` states.
6. **Payment Summary on booking detail** (§13.2). Display pre-order line
   items + deposit cards with status badges.
7. **Cancel flow with partial refund** (§6). Confirm dialog copy mentions
   the 5.5% non-refundable. Toast message varies by refund outcome.
   Cancelled bookings remain viewable.
8. **Saved-card picker** (§9 — `create-public-payment-intent` Mode B,
   `stripe-attach-payment-method`).
9. **Modify with deposit recalc** (§9 — `modify-reservation`).
   `modify_requires_card` failure case branches to "Add a card" UI.
10. **Multi-payer split deposit** (§10). Universal Link / App Link
    setup for `cenaiva://deposit/:id`.
11. **Account deletion** (§7). The typing-to-confirm modal + the toast
    + sign-out + route-to-login.
12. **Post-meal pay-the-bill** (§8 — `stripe-charge-order`). Includes
    SCA handling on the connected account.
13. **Find-reservation** (§9 — `find-reservation`). For guests who lost
    their confirmation.
14. **Error paths.** Decline, insufficient funds, SCA required, network
    timeouts. Use the test cards in §16.
15. **Final integration test.** Real card, real PI, full loop, verify
    restaurant's Stripe Dashboard shows the destination charge + app fee.

## 20. Reference paths in repo (web canonical implementation)

When in doubt, mirror what the web does. The web's deferred-PI flow is
the most-tested production code path; mobile should match call ordering
and error handling closely.

### Diner UI

- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/RestaurantPublicPage.tsx` — `handlePlaceOrder`,
  `createReservationCore`, the full checkout flow. Search "Phase 7" for
  split-deposit logic.
- `apps/web/src/components/booking/StripePaymentForm.tsx` — dual-mode
  picker (Phase 4): saved-card path + one-time path with save-card
  checkbox + SCA fallback via `handleNextAction`.
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/BookingDetailsPage.tsx` — cancel flow,
  refund toast variants, modify dialog with deposit_adjustment
  toast variants.
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/BookingsPage.tsx` — list-page cancel
  dialog.
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/DepositPayPage.tsx` — public
  `/deposit/:id` page (Phase 7).
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/FindReservationPage.tsx` — anon
  `/find-reservation` page (code + contact paths).
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/ConnectedAccountsPage.tsx` — proactive
  linking (Phase 5).
- `apps/web/src/pages/customer/AccountPage.tsx` — payment methods
  management + delete-account UI.
- `apps/web/src/pages/auth/AuthCallbackPage.tsx` — Apple first-signin
  name capture + duplicate-account merge prompt.
- `apps/web/src/pages/auth/PhoneLoginPage.tsx` — Phone OTP UI
  (SMS + WhatsApp transports).
- `apps/web/src/pages/auth/OnboardingPage.tsx` — missing-fields gate.
- `apps/web/src/components/customer/AccountLinkPrompt.tsx` — the
  merge prompt modal.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useReservationPayments.ts` — Payment Summary
  fetcher (the query mobile should mirror).
- `apps/web/src/lib/validation/phone-schemas.ts` — E.164 normalization +
  display formatting (mobile should mirror).

### Owner UI (out-of-scope for mobile diner, kept for context)

- `apps/web/src/components/onboarding/Step8PaymentSetup.tsx` — Stripe
  Connect Embedded + subscription card setup.
- `apps/web/src/pages/dashboard/SettingsPage.tsx` — billing summary,
  plan price constants ($199 CAD, 5.5%).
- `apps/web/src/pages/auth/SetupPage.tsx` — wizard shell.
- `apps/web/src/pages/auth/DraftsPage.tsx` — unpublished restaurants.

### Edge functions

## 21. Out of scope for diner mobile

- **Restaurant onboarding** (Stripe Connect KYC, subscription setup,
  Step 8 of wizard) — owner-side web only. See §11 for context.
- **Subscription billing** ($199/mo) — owner-side web only.
- **Payouts dashboard / fee reporting** — restaurants view this in their
  Stripe Dashboard directly; Cenaiva doesn't surface it.
- **Owner-side dashboard cancel** — routed through `cancel-reservation`
  with `actor: "owner"`. Diner mobile inherits the diner-side messaging
  automatically.
- **Tip-after-meal flow** as a standalone — current `stripe-charge-order`
  bundles tip into the bill at close time. No separate add-a-tip UI yet.
- **Stripe webhook subscriptions** — server-side only.
- **Restaurant subscription management** — owner-side `/dashboard/settings`.
- **Stripe Customer merge across diner accounts** — `merge-diner-accounts`
  doesn't migrate Stripe Customer ids; orphaned cards on the duplicate
  Customer become uncharge-able. Workaround: re-add the card. Document
  for diner support.

This guide is current as of **2026-05-16** (pricing overhaul: 5.5% / $199 /
Cenaiva absorbs Stripe / cancel keeps 5.5%). If you find drift between
this doc and code, update both in the same PR.
